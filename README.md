I recently completed a comprehensive SQL project using the Atliq Hardware Database, focusing on solving ad-hoc business queries to generate valuable insights for data-driven decision-making.
✅ Project Overview:
Atliq Hardware (imaginary company) aimed to expand its data analytics team with SQL experts capable of handling both technical and strategic queries. I worked on several business challenges designed to test both skillsets.
🔍 Key Insights Generated:
📌 Identified markets where Atliq Exclusive operates in the APAC region.
📌 Analyzed the percentage increase in unique products from 2020 to 2021.
📌 Reported the top 5 customers receiving high discounts in the Indian market (2021).
📌 Compared segment-wise growth in unique products over multiple years.
📌 Determined highest and lowest manufacturing costs for products.
📌 Generated monthly gross sales reports and identified top-performing sales channels.
💡 Technical Highlights:
Utilized Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for complex calculations.
Applied window functions for ranking and comparisons.
Delivered business-ready insights with optimized SQL queries.
This project strengthened my ability to handle real-world data challenges and draw meaningful insights through SQL.
